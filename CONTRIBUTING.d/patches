Name
       Patches - instructions for contributing patches

Description
       If you know how to fix a problem in a manual page (if not, see
       <CONTRIBUTING.d/bugs>), then send a patch in an email.

       -  Follow the instructions for sending mail to the mailing list
          from <CONTRIBUTING.d/mail>.

       -  The subject of the email should contain "[patch]" in the
          subject line.

       The above is the minimum needed so that someone might respond to
       your patch.  If you did that and someone does not respond within
       a few days, then ping the email thread, "replying to all".  Make
       sure to send it to the maintainers in addition to the mailing
       list.

       To make your patch even more useful, please note the following
       points:

       -  Write a suitable subject line.  Make sure to mention the
          name(s) of the page(s) being patched.  Example:

             [patch] shmop.2: Add "(void *)" cast to RETURN VALUE

       -  Sign your patch with "Signed-off-by:".  Read about the
          "Developer's Certificate of Origin" at
          <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst>.
          When appropriate, other tags documented in that file, such as
          "Reported-by:", "Reviewed-by:", "Acked-by:", and
          "Suggested-by:" can be added to the patch.  The man-pages
          project also uses a "Cowritten-by:" tag with the obvious
          meaning.  Example:

              Signed-off-by: Alejandro Colomar <alx@kernel.org>

       -  Describe how you obtained the information in your patch.  For
          example, was it:

          -  by reading (or writing) the relevant kernel or (g)libc
             source code?  Please provide a pointer to the following
             code.

          -  from a commit message in the kernel or (g)libc source code
             repository?  Please provide a commit ID.

          -  by writing a test program?  Send it with the patch, but
             please make sure it's as simple as possible, and provide
             instructions on how to use it and/or a demo run.

          -  from a standards document?  Please name the standard, and
             quote the relevant text.

          -  from other documentation?  Please provide a pointer to that
             documentation.

          -  from a mailing list or online forum?  Please provide a URL
             if possible.

       -  Send patches in diff -u format in an email patch.  You may
          find it useful to employ git-send-email(1) and
          git-format-patch(1).

       -  Where relevant, include source code comments that cite commit
          hashes for relevant kernel or glibc changes:

              .\" commit <40-character-git-hash>

       -  For trivial patches, you can use subject tags:

          -  ffix: Formatting fix.
          -  tfix: Typo fix.
          -  wfix: Minor wording fix.
          -  srcfix: Change to manual page source that doesn't affect
             the output.

          Example:

              [patch] tcp.7: tfix

       -  Send logically separate patches.  For unrelated pages, or for
          logically-separate issues in the same page, send separate
          emails.

       -  Make patches against the latest version of the manual page.
          Use git(1) for getting the latest version.
