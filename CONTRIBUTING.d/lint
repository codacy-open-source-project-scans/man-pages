       Lint - instructions for linting manual pages

Description
       If you plan to patch a manual page, consider running the linters
       and checks configured in the build system, to make sure your
       change doesn't add new warnings.  However, you might still get
       warnings that are not your fault.  To minimize that, do the
       following steps:

       (1)  First use make(1)'s -t option, so that make(1) knows that it
            only needs to lint & check again pages that you will touch.

                $ make -t lint check >/dev/null

       (2)  Run make(1) again, asking it to imagine that the page wou'll
            modify has been touched, to see which warnings you'll still
            see from that page that are not your fault.

                $ # replace 'man2/membarrier.2' by the page you'll modify
                $ make -W man2/membarrier.2 -k lint check

       (3)  Apply your changes, and then run make(1) again.  You can
            ignore warnings that you saw in step (2), but if you see any
            new ones, please fix them if you know how, or at least note
            them in your patch email.

                $ vi man2/membarrier.2  # do your work
                $ make -k lint check

       See <INSTALL> for a list of dependencies that this feature
       requires.  If you can't meet them all, don't worry; it will still
       run the linters and checks that you have available.
